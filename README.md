# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2021)
puzzles, written in Python3.

## Setup & Usage

* Have Python3 installed (I used 3.10 but 3.6 and above should be fine)
* To calculate the solution to a given day, run the respective file with the
  corresponding input  
  For Example: `$ python3 01_calorie-counting.py inputs/01_calories.txt`
* You can also calculate all solutions at once using `run_all.sh`
